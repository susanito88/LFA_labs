## Theory
Formal languages help in understanding how languages are structured and processed. A formal language consists of an alphabet (a finite set of symbols) and a set of valid strings formed using these symbols, following specific rules known as grammar. Regular grammars, a subset of formal grammars, simplify production rules and can describe many natural and artificial languages, but they cannot capture the full complexity of all languages.

A grammar G is usually defined as a tuple `G = (V_N, V_T, P, S)`, where:

- **`V_N`** is a set of non-terminal symbols.
- **`V_T`** is a set of terminal symbols.
- **`P`** is a set of production rules that define how strings are formed.
- **`S`** is the start symbol, a non-terminal that initiates string generation.

Regular grammars define regular languages, which are a type of formal language. They come in two forms: **right-linear grammars** and **left-linear grammars**.

- **Right-linear grammar** follows rules like `A → aB` or `A → a`, where `A` and `B` are non-terminal symbols and `a` is a terminal.
- **Left-linear grammar** follows rules like `A → Ba` or `A → a`, with a similar structure.

Regular languages can be processed by **finite automata**, abstract machines that read input symbol by symbol, transitioning between states according to predefined rules.

A **finite automaton (FA)** is defined as a tuple `FA = (Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F)`, where:

- **`Q`** is a finite set of states.
- **`Σ`** is the input alphabet.
- **`δ`** is the transition function `δ: Q × Σ → Q`, determining state transitions based on input symbols.
- **`q_0`** is the initial state from which processing starts.
- **`F`** is a set of accepting states.

To convert a grammar into a finite automaton, we map grammar components (non-terminals, terminals, production rules, and start symbol) to automaton elements (states, alphabet, transition function, initial state, and accepting states). This allows regular grammars to be represented and processed using finite automata.

## Objectives:
* Implement a type/class for your grammar;
* Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar;
* Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;
* For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;


## Implementation description
### **1. `generate_string()` Function**
This function generates a valid string from the language defined by the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S and iteratively replaces non-terminal symbols with randomly chosen production rules until only terminal symbols remain. The process ensures that the generated string adheres to the grammar's production rules.

```python
def generate_string(self):
    string = self.start_symbol
    while any(v in string for v in self.vn):
        for v in string:
            if v in self.vn:
                string = string.replace(v, random.choice(self.p[v]), 1)
                break
    return string 
```

### **2. `to_finite_automaton()` Function**
This function converts the grammar into a finite automaton. It constructs the automaton by mapping the grammar's non-terminals to states, terminals to the alphabet, and production rules to the transition function. The start state is the grammar's start symbol, and the final states are determined by identifying states that only produce terminal symbols. Additionally, state C is manually added as a final state.

```python
def to_finite_automaton(self):
    q = self.vn  # states
    sigma = self.vt  # alphabet
    q0 = self.start_symbol  # start state
    delta = {}  # transition func

    for key in self.p.keys():
        for rule in self.p[key]:
            if key not in delta:
                delta[key] = []
            if len(rule) == 2:
                delta[key].append((rule[0], rule[1]))  # (input symbol, next state)
            else:
                delta[key].append((rule[0], None))  # terminal transition

    # find final states (terminal only strings)
    f = {key for key in self.p if all(rule in self.vt for rule in self.p[key])}
    f.add('C')  # C is final state

    return FiniteAutomaton(q, sigma, delta, q0, f)
```

### **3. `string_belongs_to_language()` Function**
This function checks if a given input string belongs to the language recognized by the finite automaton. It simulates the automaton's state transitions based on the input symbols. If the automaton reaches a final state after processing the entire string, the string is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.

```python
def string_belongs_to_language(self, input_string):
    current_state = self.q0

    for c in input_string:
        if c not in self.sigma or current_state not in self.delta:
            return False

        next_state = None
        for transition in self.delta[current_state]:
            if c == transition[0]:  # if the transition matches input
                next_state = transition[1] if transition[1] is not None else current_state
                break

        if next_state is None:
            return False  # no valid transition

        current_state = next_state

    return current_state in self.f
```

### **4. Testing the Implementation**
The script **generates and prints** five valid strings using `grammar.generate_string()`.

It **checks whether test strings belong to the language** using `fa.string_belongs_to_language()`, printing `True` or `False` for each test case.

```python
from grammar import Grammar

grammar = Grammar()

print("Generated Strings:")
for _ in range(5):
    print(grammar.generate_string())

fa = grammar.to_finite_automaton()

print("\nCheck if strings belong to L:")
test_strings = ["aabb", "abaabb", "babb", "ab", "abababababababaaaaabb"]
for s in test_strings:
    print(f"'{s}' - {fa.string_belongs_to_language(s)}")
```

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results

The execution of the **Grammar to Finite Automaton conversion** and the **string recognition process** was successful.

**String Generation Results**:
- The system **generates valid strings** from the given grammar.
- Each string follows the production rules defined in the grammar.

**Finite Automaton String Validation**:
- The automaton correctly classified strings as **belonging (TRUE)** or **not belonging (FALSE)** to the language.
